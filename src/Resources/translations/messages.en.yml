                Use the rules to set a shipping rate based on the country of the shipping address. Whether you use the 
                inclusion mode, if the country of the address corresponds to a country of the rule, the rate of the rule
                is applied. If you use the exclusion mode, in the event that the country of the address does not matches
                no country of the rule, the rule is applied. Note that only the rate for the 1st rule valid encountered 
                is applied.

                Use the rules to set a shipping rate based on the postal code of the shipping address. Each rule 
                consists of masks, separated by commas. You can specify specific postal codes (80120,59160,60500) or use 
                the wildcard character * (75* for all of Paris or 2A*,2B*,20* for Corsica). If you use inclusion mode, 
                if a postcode matches a mask, the rule rate is applied. If you use the exclusion mode, if the postal code 
                does not match any mask, the rule is applied. Note that only the rate of the 1st valid rule encountered 
                are applied.
